# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Bootcamp Prework Guide>

## Description

This project was created to have references in the four coding languages we are going over in bootcamp HTML, CSS. Git, and Javascript. I will be able to use the coding I've done to make this website as a guide through future assignments and a reminder of certain syntax and commands I can use. It also gave me a little experience in coding with this languages.
